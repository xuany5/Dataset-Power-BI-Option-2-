    The dataset is 'Covid-19 Global Dataset' share by Joseph Assaker on Kaggle.

   2. the reason behind the dataset choice, what problems it is relevant to

    I chose this dataset because it is both comprehensive and statistically important. 
    It includes covid-19 data of 218 countries from 2020-2-15 to 2021-07-31. 
    It covers daily new cases, daily new deaths, active cases, cumulative cases and deaths. 
    Moreover, Covid-19 pandemic has a huge impact on society and visualising this dataset could help us understand and compare those data.
    It could also be used to visualise how vaccination might have influenced this pandemic.
   3. key insights from the data that is represented in the dashboard
  
    1. I have noticed that there is a general trend towards increased daily cases in a large number of countries from 2020 to 2021. 
    2. The death rate of covid-19 is significantly higher in developing countries.
    3. South America has one of the most large numbers of daily cases.
